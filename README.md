Hello! My name is Anthony Wijaya Saputra. I am a Mobile Applications and Technology student at BINUS University. Other than pursuing my bachelor degree at BINUS University, I also actively work as a freelancer, working on projects related to web design, motion design, and graphic design -- all fueled by my passion and interest in multimedia and programming.
I have worked on various freelance projects in the past, including collaborations with multiple clients such as Edho Zell, companies like Digima Asia, and many more.
