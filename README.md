Hi, I'm Anthony 👨‍💻👨‍🎨👋

Hello! My name is Anthony Wijaya Saputra. I am a Mobile Applications and Technology student at BINUS University. Other than pursuing my bachelor degree at BINUS University, I also actively work as a freelancer, working on projects related to web design, motion design, and graphic design -- all fueled by my passion and interest in programming and multimedia.
